    "# Introductory Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. Before you do, think about what you expect the output to be, and make sure your intuition matches up with what you run. If it doesn't, take some time to think about what happened so you can hone your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test code by running it; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to learn about functions. In computer science terms, functions are known as subroutines. A **subroutine** is defined as a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task, packaged together as a unit - i.e. a small independent piece of code. Before we talk about how to define and use functions, it's important to know why we want to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first reason for using functions is *reusability*. It stems from a methodology  called **Don't Repeat Yourself** (**DRY** for short). This methodology boils down to the idea that we want to be as concise as possible when writing code - we don't want to write unnecessary instructions, and want to avoid repeating the same or similar instructions over and over. Functions allow us to achieve this goal by giving us a tool that we can use to wrap up a set of instructions into a single independent unit. That independent unit can then be used to perform a specific task over and over, without needing to rewrite those instructions. They are written just once, in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason we want to use functions is *abstraction*. Consider the `type()` function that we have used. To use it we needed to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What the function is - i.e. its name\n",
    "2. What the function expects passed to it - i.e. the arguments\n",
    "3. What the function does\n",
    "4. What the function gives back to us - i.e. returns\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all we knew about `type()`, and we used it without any issues. The key takeaway here is that we don't need to know anything about how `type()` does what it says it's supposed to do! This is the idea of abstraction - the implementation within a function is hidden from the caller (abstracted away, if you will). There are a number of reasons why this trait is desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it allows callers of the function to not be concerned with how the function itself works. Rather, they stay safe in the assumption that the function will work (know, though, that this assumption does not always prove true, in which case you'll have to do some of your own trouble shooting). This allows functionality to be easily shared, and makes it easier to build more complex things. By using functions that other people have built, you're able to stand on their shoulders and build more complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, since the implementation is hidden from the caller, that actual implementation can change (so long as those four things listed above stay the same) and the caller won't know the difference. This makes it easy to split up problems into smaller pieces, and when something in one of those pieces needs to change, it won't affect the rest of the pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro to Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Built-in Functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our programming journey so far, we've actually seen a number of functions. We've worked with the `len()` function, which returns the length of an inputted iterable. We've also worked with the `range()` function, which returns a generator of numbers from an inputted minimum number to an inputted maximum number. There are many built-in functions that are available in Python, and you can find them [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html). Each one of these functions is constructed in a very similar way, and they all take some arbitrary number of arguments. What if we want to have functions that perform tasks other than those available to us in the built-ins, though? Tonight, we'll learn how to define our own functions in such a way that we can use them as we have been using the built-ins!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Definitions: Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we're going to figure out how to do is actually define functions. To build up to this, let's take a look back at some code we previously wrote to output a list of all of the even elements in `some_collection`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "evens = []\n",
    "for element in some_collection:\n",
    "    if element % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        evens.append(element)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's imagine that `some_collection` is actually just a list of numbers from 0 to 9 (i.e. `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`). Remember, we can use the `range()` function to create this list. To get a list of all the even numbers from 0 to 9, then, we can modify our code as follows."

    "\n",
    "What if we wanted to put this code into a function, so that we could then get a list of evens from 0 to 9 anytime we wanted without having to write the above 4 lines of code every time? This is a simple but straightforward example of reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not every function definition in Python will look the same (they'll have different names, different arguments passed to them, etc.), there is a general syntax that every function definition will follow. This syntax will look somewhat similar to the `while` and `for` loops in the sense that we will start off with some line (this line will define the function), followed by an indented block of code. That indented block of code will define what the function does. Okay, awesome! What goes on that first line, though?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line will always start off with a `def` statement followed by a space. What follows will then be the function name, a set of parentheses (without or without function parameters in them), and finally a colon. Let's see what this looks like.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def my_func():\n",
    "    pass # This pass just acts as a filler right now.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's dive a little more into each of the parts and note what's important about them. First off, the `def` statement. This is what tells Python that a function definition is being declared. This is what makes Python store your function so that it is callable later in your program. Second, the function name. The only real thing to note about this is that function naming conventions follow variable naming conventions (i.e. *snakecase*, where we lowercase our words and separate them by underscores). Next up are the parentheses. These are going to be filled with an optional and arbitrary number of parameters (which will dive into a little later). Finally, the colon, `:`. This is what is going to signal to Python that the function definition is over, and what follows will be the block of code that makes up the body of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all this information, how would we build our `evens` code from earlier into a function? All we have to do is simply copy and paste that block of code after our function definition, and indent all the lines by one level. Let's be sure to give it a more descriptive name, though..."

When we called `get_evens()` above, it encountered that `return` statement in our first iteration through our `for` loop, when `element` was equal to `0`.
