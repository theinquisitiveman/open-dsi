# Python Practice

At the end of Day 3:

* You will be able to:
	* iterate through lists, and use list methods
	* iterate through strings, and use string methods
	
* You will understand:
	* the difference between while and for loops, and when to use each
	* how to implement loops pythonically
	* the basics of iterables, what they are, how they relate to loops

At the end of Day 4	:

* You will be able to:
	* write loops to solve more complex aggregation problems
	* apply previously learned skills with a larger set of object types

* You will understand:
	* variable types
		* tuples, dictionaries, sets
		* their use cases
		* how they differ from previously known object types
