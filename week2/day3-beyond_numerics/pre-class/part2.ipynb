    "# Introductory Notes\n",

    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. Before you do, think about what you expect the output to be, and make sure your intuition matches up with what you run. If it doesn't, take some time to think about what happened so you can hone your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test things by trying them out; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "#### Working with individual characters in strings\n",
    "\n",
    "We know how to work with an entire string via some of the methods that we've discussed, but what if we wanted to work with the individual characters? There are a couple of ways to do this, but the first we'll focus on is through indexing. We know that to Python, a string is just a collection of characters. It turns out that we can access the individual characters simply by asking Python for a given numbered element in our collection (i.e. the string).  We do this by placing the element number that we want in square brackets, `[]`,  right after our string (or variable, if it's stored in one). This element number is referred to as the **index** of the character (or element, if it's not a string - more on this soon).\n"

    "Using indices like this, we can access any element of a string. But why is the element at index 1 `e`, and not `T`? After all, `T` is the first element in the string. Also, what are those negative numbers doing? In the case of the former, it turns out that Python (and many programming languages) starts indexing at 0, which means that the first element in our string (and any collection that supports indexing) is accessed via indexing at 0. We refer to languages that work this way as **zero indexed**. As for the negative numbers, this is a way to access elements starting from the end of the string, rather than the beginning. Indexing from the end starts from -1 and continues downwards from there. So, we would use -2 to access the `n` in the string.\n",

    "This indexing turns out to be pretty useful. You might notice, though, that when indexing from `[1:3]`, only the letters at index 1 and 2 are returned; when indexing from `[5:9]`, we get the letters at indices 5, 6, 7, and 8. This is because the indices that you pass in are inclusive on the left side, and exclusive on the right side. This means that when you index, you will grab letters from the starting index that you give up to but not including letters at the ending index that you give. \n",

So, if we wanted to grab every second letter from the beginning to end, we could index with `[::2]`.

Well, instead of iterating over all of the integers in a `range(len(my_str))` call like we did in our first `for` loop, we've gotten Python to simply iterate over all of the individual characters in our string, `my_str`. In each iteration of this `for` loop, `char` stores a different letter of `my_str`, and then the call `print char` prints that character. In the end, we get the same result as either of our `while` loops above, and the less Pythonic `for` loop that we wrote above.

We can also note that our code just looks cleaner and more simple, too.

    "How is this working? Well, in each case, it's filling in a given part of our string with the value of our variable. In the first case, we use a `%` sign to denote where the replacement should happen, followed by a letter to denote what type of variable will be passed in there (`s` is used for string, `d` is for a decimal, etc.). You can find what each letter denotes [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting). In the second case, we use brackets `{}` to denote where the replacement should take place. We can also place numbers, or even variable names themselves inside these brackets and referece them in the `format()` method..."
