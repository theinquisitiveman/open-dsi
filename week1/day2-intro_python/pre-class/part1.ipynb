There are a number of these base numeric variable types built into Python, and all of them represent a very simple idea, numbers. The ones that we will be looking at today are `ints`, short for integers, `floats`, short for floating point decimal numbers, and `complex`, which contain real and imaginary parts stored as floats."

The name duck comes from the classic \"If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\" adage.

There is a big difference between seeing a variable called `degrees` and one called `y`. You should strive to give your variables well-defined, succinct names.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are of course cases where using less than descriptive variable names follows convention and are, therefore, just fine to use. A common example is the use of `i` to keep track of an index (we will cover this idea next week). Because of its prevalent usage for indexing, it is usually easy to understand what is happening in that context when all you see is the varible name `i`. Here, the lack of descriptiveness is okay. The important thing is that the code is **understandable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we saw no output from either `x = 5` or `y = 2` above. This is because the return value that would have been printed as output was assigned to the variables `x` and `y`, respectively. This is why we had to view them in the next lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of variables' power is the fact that they can change (vary, if you will). This allows us to use a single variable name to keep track of a specific thing throughout the life of a program. Remember how we assigned the value `5` to `x` above? The exact same syntax can be used to change the value stored in the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we want to make the value of `x` five more than it currently is. All we need to do is have x be assigned the value that results from adding 5 to `x`."
